                    <h3>What is Web API?</h3>
                    A web API is an application programming interface (API) for interacting with a web server using HTTP requests.<br>
                    It is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with web-based software and applications.<br>
                    A web API allows for communication between different software systems, and can be used to retrieve or manipulate data over the internet.<br>
                    Web APIs are commonly used to access web-based databases or services, such as social media platforms, weather services, and online marketplaces.<br>
                    They can be accessed by various clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers.                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Where can web api be application?</h3>
                    <p>Web APIs can be used by application developers to access various web-based services and resources. Some examples of web APIs include:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Social media APIs: These allow developers to access data and functionality from social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</li>
                            <li>Weather APIs: These allow developers to access weather data, such as current conditions, forecasts, and historical data.</li>
                            <li>News APIs: These allow developers to access news content and metadata from various news sources.</li>
                            <li>Payment APIs: These allow developers to access payment processing functionality, such as accepting credit card payments or processing PayPal transactions.</li>
                            <li>Geolocation APIs: These allow developers to access geolocation data, such as latitude and longitude coordinates, and perform reverse geocoding to determine a physical address.</li>
                            <li>Mapping APIs: These allow developers to access mapping data and functionality, such as displaying maps and markers, and performing routing and directions.</li>
                            <li>Database APIs: These allow developers to access data stored in web-based databases, such as MySQL, MongoDB and Firebase.</li>
                            <li>Cloud storage APIs: These allow developers to access and manage files stored in cloud storage platforms, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    There are many other types of web APIs available, and new ones are being developed all the time. These are just a few examples of the wide range of functionality that can be accessed through web APIs.</p>
